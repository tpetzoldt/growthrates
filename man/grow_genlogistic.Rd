\title{Generalized Logistic Growth Model}
\usage{
ode_genlogistic(time, y, parms, ...)

grow_genlogistic(time, parms, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{time}{vector of simulation time steps}

\item{y}{named vector with initial value of the system (e.g. cell concentration)}

\item{parms}{parameters of the generalized logistic growth model
\itemize{
   \item \code{mumax} maximum growth rate (1/time)
   \item \code{K} carrying capacity (max. abundance)
   \item \code{alpha, beta, gamma} parameters determining the shape of growth.
     Setting all values to one returns the ordinary logistic function.
}}

\item{\dots}{additional parameters passed to the \code{ode}-function.}
}
\value{
For \code{ode_genlogistic}: matrix containing the simulation outputs.
The return value of has also class \code{deSolve}.

For \code{grow_genlogistic}: vector of dependent variable (\code{y}).

\itemize{
\item \code{time} time of the simulation
\item \code{y} abundance of organisms
}
}
\description{
Generalized logistic growth model solved as differential equation.
}
\details{
The model is given as its first derivative:

\deqn{dy/dt = mumax * y^alpha * (1-(y/K)^beta)^gamma}

that is then numerically integrated ('simulated') according to time (t).

The generalized logistic according to Tsoularis (2001) is a flexible
  model that covers exponential and logistic growth, Richards, Gompertz, von
  Bertalanffy, and some more as special cases.

  The differential equation is solved numerically, where function
  \code{ode_genlogistic} is the differential equation, and
  \code{grow_genlogistic} runs a numerical simulation over time.

  The default version \code{grow_genlogistic} is run directly as compiled code,
  whereas the R versions \code{ode_logistic} is
  provided for testing by the user.
