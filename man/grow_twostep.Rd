\title{Twostep Growth Model}
\usage{
ode_twostep(time, y, parms, ...)

grow_twostep(time, parms, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{time}{actual time (for the ode) resp. vector of simulation time steps.}

\item{y}{named vector with state of the system
(yi, ya: abundance of inactive and active organisms, e.g.
concentration of inactive resp. active cells).}

\item{parms}{parameters of the two-step growth model:
\itemize{
   \item \code{yi, ya} initial abundance of active and inactive organisms,
   \item \code{kw} activation (``wakeup'') constant (1/time),
   \item \code{mumax} maximum growth rate (1/time),
   \item \code{K} carrying capacity (max. abundance).
}}

\item{\dots}{placeholder for additional parameters (for user-extended versions of this function)}
}
\value{
For \code{ode_twostep}: matrix containing the simulation outputs.
The return value of has also class \code{deSolve}.

For \code{grow_twostep}: vector of dependent variable (\code{y}):

\itemize{
\item \code{time} time of the simulation
\item \code{yi} concentration of inactive cells
\item \code{ya} concentration of active cells
\item \code{y} total cell concentration
}
}
\description{
System of two differential equations describing bacterial growth as two-step
process of activation (or adaptation) and growth.
}
\details{
The model is given as a system of two differential equations:

\deqn{dy_i/dt = -kw * yi}
\deqn{dy_a/dt =  kw * yi + mumax * (1 - (yi + ya)/K) * ya}

that are then numerically integrated ('simulated') according to time (t). The
model assumes that the population consists of active (\eqn{y_a}) and inactive
(\eqn{y_i}) cells so that the observed abundance is (\eqn{y = y_i + y_a}).
Adapting inactive cells change to the active state with a first order 'wakeup'
rate (\eqn{kw}).

Function \code{ode_twostep} is the system of differential equations,
whereas \code{grow_twostep} runs a numerical simulation over time.

A similar two-compartment model, but without the logistic term, was discussed by Baranyi (1998).

time <- seq(0, 30, length=200)
parms <- c(kw = 0.1,	mumax=0.2, K=0.1)
y0    <-  c(yi=0.01, ya=0.0)
out   <- ode(y0, time, ode_twostep, parms)

o <- grow_twostep(0:100, c(yi=0.01, ya=0.0, kw = 0.1,	mumax=0.2, K=0.1))
